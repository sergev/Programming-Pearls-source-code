<h1>The Preface to
<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font></h1>

<P>
Computer programming has many faces.
Fred Brooks paints the big picture in
<I>The Mythical Man Month</I>;
his essays underscore the crucial role of
management in large software projects.
At a finer grain,
Steve McConnell teaches good programming style in
<I>Code Complete</I>.
The topics in those books are the key to
good software and the hallmark of the professional programmer.
Unfortunately, though,
the workmanlike application of those sound
engineering principles isn't always thrilling -- until the
software is completed on time and works without surprise.

<H3>About the Book</H3>

The columns in this book are about a more glamorous
aspect of the profession:
programming pearls whose origins lie beyond solid engineering,
in the realm of insight and creativity.
Just as natural pearls grow from grains of sand
that have irritated oysters,
these programming pearls have grown from real
problems that have irritated real programmers.
The programs are fun,
and they teach important programming techniques
and fundamental design principles.

<P>
Most of these essays originally appeared in
my ``Programming Pearls'' column in
<I>Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery</I>.
They were collected, revised
and published as the first edition of this book in 1986.
Twelve of the thirteen pieces in the first edition
have been edited substantially for this edition,
and three new columns have been added.

<P>
The only background the book assumes is
programming experience in a high-level language.
Advanced techniques (such as templates in C++)
show up now and then,
but the reader unfamiliar with such topics
will be able to skip to the next section with impunity.

<P>
Although each column may be read by itself,
there is a logical grouping to the complete set.
Columns 1 through 5 form
<a href="part1.html">Part I</a>
of the book.
They review programming fundamentals:
problem definition, algorithms,
data structures and program verification and testing.
<a href="part2.html">Part II</a>
is built around the theme of efficiency,
which is sometimes important in itself and is always a fine
springboard into interesting programming problems.
<a href="part3.html">Part III</a>
applies those techniques to several
substantial problems in sorting, searching and strings.

<P>
One hint about reading the essays: don't go too fast.
Read them carefully, one per sitting.
Try the problems as they are posed -- some of them
look easy until you've butted your head
against them for an hour or two.
Afterwards, work hard on the problems
at the end of each column:
most of what you learn from this book
will come out the end of your
pencil as you scribble down your solutions.
If possible,
discuss your ideas with friends and colleagues
before peeking at the hints and solutions
in the back of the book.
The further reading at the end of each chapter isn't
intended as a scholarly reference list;
I've recommended some good books that are
an important part of my personal library.

<P>
This book is written for programmers.
I hope that the problems, hints, solutions,
and further reading make it useful for individuals.
The book has been used in classes including
Algorithms, Program Verification and Software Engineering.
The catalog of algorithms in Appendix 1
is a reference for practicing programmers,
and also shows how the book can be integrated into classes
on algorithms and data structures.

<H3>The Code</H3>

<P>
The pseudocode programs in the first edition
of the book were all implemented,
but I was the only person to see the real code.
For this edition,
I have rewritten all the old programs and
written about the same amount of new code.
The programs are available
<a href="code.html">at this book's web site</a>.
The code includes much of the scaffolding for
testing, debugging and timing the functions.
The site also contains other relevant material.
Because so much software is now available online,
a new theme in this edition is how to
evaluate and use software components.

<P>
The programs use a terse coding style:
short variable names, few blank lines,
and little or no error checking.
This is inappropriate in large software projects,
but it is useful to convey the key ideas of algorithms.
<a href="sol05.html">Solution 5.1</a>
gives more background on this style.

<P>
<a name="pseudocode">
The text includes a few real C and C++ programs,
but most functions are expressed in a pseudocode
that takes less space and avoids inelegant syntax.
The notation
<I>for i = [0, n)</I> iterates
<I>i</I> from 0 through <I>n-1</I>.
In these <I>for</I> loops,
left and right parentheses denote open ranges
(which do not include the end values),
and left and right square brackets denote closed ranges
(which do include the end values).
The phrase <I>function(i, j)</I> still calls
a function with parameters <I>i</I> and <I>j</I>,
and <I>array[i, j]</I> still accesses an array element.

<P>
This edition reports the run times
of many programs on ``my computer'',
a 400MHz Pentium II with 128 megabytes of RAM
running Windows NT 4.0.
I timed the programs on several other machines,
and the book reports the few substantial differences
that I observed.
All experiments used the highest available level
of compiler optimization.
I encourage you to time the programs on your machine;
I bet that you'll find similar ratios of run times.

<a name="firstedition">
<H3>To Readers of the First Edition</H3>

<P>
I hope that your first response
as you thumb through this edition of the book is,
``This sure looks familiar.''
A few minutes later,
I hope that you'll observe,
``I've never seen that before.''

<P>
This version has the same focus as the first edition,
but is set in a larger context.
Computing has grown substantially
in important areas such as databases,
networking and user interfaces.
Most programmers should be familiar users
of such technologies.
At the center of each of those areas,
though, is a hard core of programming problems.
Those programs remain the theme of this book.
This edition of the book is a slightly larger fish
in a much larger pond.

<P>
One section from old Column 4 on implementing binary search
grew into new
<a href="sketch05.html">Column 5</a>
on testing, debugging and timing.
Old Column 11 grew and split into new
Columns 12 (on the original problem) and
13 (on set representations).
Old Column 13 described a spelling checker
that ran in a 64-kilobyte address space;
it has been deleted,
but its heart lives on in Section 13.8.
New
<a href="sol15.html">Column 15</a>
is about string problems.
Many sections have been inserted into the old columns,
and other sections were deleted along the way.
With new problems, new solutions,
and four new appendices,
this edition of the book is 25 percent longer.

<P>
Many of the old case studies in this edition are unchanged,
for their historical interest.
A few old stories have been recast in modern terms.

<h3>Acknowledgments for the First Edition</h3>

<P>
I am grateful for much support from many people.
The idea for a
<I>Communications of the ACM</I>
column was originally conceived by Peter Denning
and Stuart Lynn.
Peter worked diligently within ACM to make the column
possible and recruited me for the job.
ACM Headquarters staff,
particularly Roz Steier and Nancy Adriance,
have been very supportive as these columns
were published in their original form.
I am especially indebted to the ACM for encouraging
publication of the columns in their present form,
and to the many
<i>CACM</i>
readers who made this expanded version necessary
and possible by their comments on the original columns.

<P>
Al Aho,
Peter Denning,
Mike Garey,
David Johnson,
Brian Kernighan,
John Linderman,
Doug McIlroy
and
Don Stanat
have all read each column with great care,
often under extreme time pressure.
I am also grateful for the particularly helpful comments of
Henry Baird,
Bill Cleveland,
David Gries,
Eric Grosse,
Lynn Jelinski,
Steve Johnson,
Bob Melville,
Bob Martin,
Arno Penzias,
Marilyn Roper,
Chris Van Wyk,
Vic Vyssotsky
and

Al Aho,
Andrew Hume,
Brian Kernighan,
Ravi Sethi,
Laura Skinger
and
Bjarne Stroustrup
provided invaluable help in bookmaking,
and West Point cadets in EF 485 field tested
the penultimate draft of the manuscript.
Thanks, all.
