<h1>Precise Problem Statement
<br>(Section 1.2 of
<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font>)
</h1>


To the programmer these requirements
added up to,
``How do I sort a disk file?''
Before we attack the problem,
let's arrange what we know in a less biased and more useful form.
<DL>
<DT>
<i>Input</i>:
<DD>
A file containing at most <i>n</i> positive integers,
each less than <i>n</i>,
where <i>n</i> = 10<sup>7</sup>.
It is a fatal error if any integer
occurs twice in the input.
No other data is associated with the integer.

<br><br><DT>
<i>Output</i>:
<DD>
A sorted list in increasing order of the input integers.

<br><br><DT>
<i>Constraints</i>:
<DD>
At most (roughly) a megabyte of storage is available in main memory;
ample disk storage is available.
The run time can be at most several minutes;
a run time of ten seconds need not be decreased.
</DL>

<br>
Think for a minute about this problem specification.
How would you advise the programmer now?
