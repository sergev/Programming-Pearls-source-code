<h1>Sorting Algorithm Animations from
<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font></h1>

<p>
Column 11 describes Insertion Sort and two Quicksorts
(a simple version and the typical version using 2-way partitioning).
Column 14 describes Heapsort.
This page animates those algorithms and
two additional simple sorting algorithms
from the Solutions to Column 11:
Selection Sort and Shell Sort.
</p>

<p>
To view an animation,
hit the run button below.
Each dot represents an element in the array;
the x-value is the element's index and
the y-value is the element's value.
Thus a random array is a uniform smear of points,
and a sorted array is a trail of points wandering
from the bottom left to the top right.
</p>

<p>
To experiment with the algorithms,
select a value of n,
an input distribution,
and a sorting algorithm before hitting run.
For each algorithm,
be sure to start with a small value of n,
and work up to larger values.
WARNING!
There is no way to stop an animation in progress
(this is a simple Java program) other than by
terminating your browser.
Enjoy!

<p>
This animation shows the essential algorithms,
but has few bells and whistles.
Most of the algorithms sort the array a[0..n-1].
<b>BEWARE!</b>
The Heapsort takes a sleazy shortcut around the problem
of zero-indexed arrays:
it sorts the array a[1..n-1],
and leaves a[0] dangling in mid-air.
