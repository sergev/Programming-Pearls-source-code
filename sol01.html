<a href="qsortints.c">This C program</a>
uses the Standard Library <i>qsort</i>
to sort a file of integers.

int a[1000000];

    return 0;

<a href="sortints.cpp">This C++ program</a>
uses the <i>set</i>
container from the Standard Template Library
for the same job.

Solution 3 sketches the performance of both programs.

These functions use the constants to set, clear and test
the value of a bit:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
#define BITSPERWORD 32
#define SHIFT 5
#define MASK 0x1F
#define N 10000000
int a[1 + N/BITSPERWORD];

void set(int i) {        a[i>>SHIFT] |=  (1<<(i & MASK)); }
void clr(int i) {        a[i>>SHIFT] &= ~(1<<(i & MASK)); }
int  test(int i){ return a[i>>SHIFT] &   (1<<(i & MASK)); }
</PRE></TT></DL>

<a href="bitsort.c">This C code</a>
implements the sorting algorithm,
using the functions defined in Solution 2.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
int main(void)
{   int i;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        clr(i);
    while (scanf("%d", &i) != EOF)
        set(i);
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        if (test(i))
            printf("%d\n", i);
    return 0;

I used the program in Solution 4 to generate a file
of one million distinct positive integers,
each less than ten million.
This table reports the cost of sorting them
with the system command-line sort,
the C++ and C programs in Solution 1,
and the bitmap code:
<br>
<TABLE COLS=5 BORDER=ON ALIGN=CENTER>
<THEAD>
<TR><TH><TH>System Sort<TH>C++/STL<TH>C/qsort<TH>C/bitmaps</TR>
</THEAD>
<TBODY>
<TR><TD>Total Secs<TD>89<TD>38<TD>12.6<TD>10.7</TR>
<TR><TD>Compute Secs<TD>79<TD>28<TD>2.4<TD>.5</TR>
<TR><TD>Megabytes<TD>.8<TD>70<TD>4<TD>1.25</TR>
</TBODY>
</TABLE>
<br>
The first line reports the total time,
and the second line subtracts out the 10.2 seconds
of input/output required to read and write the files.
Even though the general C++ program uses 50 times the
memory and CPU time of the specialized C program,
it requires just half the code and is much easier to extend
to other problems.

<p>
4.
See Column 12, especially Problem 12.8.
<a href="bitsortgen.c">This code</a>
assumes that <i>randint(l, u)</i> returns
a random integer in <i>l..u</i>.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
for i = [0, n)
    x[i] = i
for i = [0, k)
    swap(i, randint(i, n-1))
    print x[i]
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>swap</i> function exchanges the two elements in <i>x</i>.
The <i>randint</i> function is discussed in detail in Section 12.1.

5.
Representing all ten million numbers with a bitmap
requires that many bits,
or 1.25 million bytes.
Employing the fact that no phone numbers begin
with the digits zero or one reduces the memory
to exactly one million bytes.
Alternatively, a two-pass algorithm first sorts the integers
0 through 4,999,999 using 5,000,000/8 = 625,000
words of storage,
then sorts 5,000,000 through 9,999,999 in a second pass.
A <i>k</i>-pass algorithm sorts at most <i>n</i> nonrepeated
positive integers less than <i>n</i>
in time <i>kn</i> and space <i>n</i>/<i>k</i>.

<p>
6.
If each integer appears at most ten times, then we can count
its occurrences in a four-bit half-byte (or nybble).
Using the solution to Problem 5,
we can sort the complete file
in a single pass with 10,000,000/2 bytes,
or in <i>k</i> passes with 10,000,000/2<i>k</i> bytes.

9.
The effect of initializing the vector <i>data</i>[0..<i>n</i>-1]
can be accomplished with a signature contained
in two additional <i>n</i>-element vectors,
<i>from</i> and <i>to</i>, and an integer <i>top</i>.
If the element <i>data</i>[<i>i</i>] has been initialized,
then <i>from</i>[<i>i</i>] < <i>top</i>
and <i>to</i>[<i>from</i>[<i>i</i>]]=<i>i</i>.
Thus <i>from</i> is a simple signature,
and <i>to</i> and <i>top</i> together make sure that <i>from</i>
is not accidentally signed by the random contents of memory.
Blank entries of <i>data</i> are
uninitialized in this picture:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="Initialization Structure" ALIGN=center src="ahuinit.jpg">
<br>
The variable <i>top</i> is initially zero;
the array element <i>i</i> is first accessed by the code
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
from[i] = top
to[top] = i
data[i] = 0
top++
</PRE></TT></DL>
This problem and solution are from Exercise 2.12 of
Aho, Hopcroft and Ullman's
<i>Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms</i>,
published by Addison-Wesley in 1974.
It combines key indexing and a wily signature scheme.
It can be used for matrices as well as vectors.

The store placed the paper order forms in a
10x10 array of bins,
using the last two digits of the
customer's phone number as the hash index.
When the customer telephoned an order,
it was placed in the proper bin.
When the customer arrived to retrieve the merchandise,
the salesperson sequentially searched through the orders in the
appropriate bin -- this is classical ``open
hashing with collision resolution by sequential search''.
The last two digits of the phone number are quite close to random
and therefore an excellent hash function,
while the first two digits would be
a horrible hash function -- why?
Some municipalities use a similar scheme to record
deeds in sets of record books.

The computers at the two facilities were linked by microwave,
but printing the drawings at the test base would have
required a printer that was very expensive at the time.
The team therefore drew the pictures at the main plant,
photographed them,
and sent 35mm film to the test station by carrier pigeon,
where it was enlarged and printed photographically.
The pigeon's 45-minute flight took half the time of the car,
and cost only a few dollars per day.
During the 16 months of the project the pigeons transmitted
several hundred rolls of film,
and only two were lost
(hawks inhabit the area;
no classified data was carried).
Because of the low price of modern printers,
a current solution to the problem would probably use
the microwave link.

According to the urban legend,
the Soviets solved their problem with a pencil,
of course.
For background on the true story, learn about the
<a href="http://www.spacepen.com">
Fisher Space Pen company</a>.
The company was founded in 1948,
and its writing instruments have been used by
the Russian Space Agency,
underwater explorers,
and Himalayan climbing expeditions.
