<h1>Words
<br>(Section 15.1 of

</h1>

<p>
Our first problem is to produce
a list of the words contained in a document.
(Feed such a program a few hundred books,
and you have a fine start at a word list for a dictionary.)
But what exactly is a word?
We'll use the trivial definition of
a sequence of characters surrounded by white space,
but this means that web pages will contain
many ``words'' like ``&lt;html&gt;'', ``&lt;body&gt;'' and ``&amp;nbsp;''.
Problem
<a href="sec155.html#p1">1</a>
asks how you might avoid such problems.

<p>
Our first C++ program uses the <i>set</i>s and <i>string</i>s
of the Standard Template Library,
in a slight modification of the program in
<a href="sol01.html#p1">Solution 1.1</a>:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
int main(void)
{   set<string> S;
    set<string>::iterator j;
    string t;
    while (cin >> t)
        S.insert(t);
    for (j = S.begin(); j != S.end(); ++j)
        cout << *j << "\n";
    return 0;
}
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>while</i> loop reads the input and <i>insert</i>s each
word into the set <i>S</i>
(by the STL specification, duplicates are ignored).
The <i>for</i> loop then iterates through the set,
and writes the words in sorted order.
This program is elegant and fairly efficient
(more on that topic soon).

Our next problem is to count the number of times
each word occurs in the document.
Here are the 21 most common words in the King James Bible,
sorted in decreasing numeric order
and aligned in three columns to save space:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
the  62053         shall 9756         they 6890
and  38546         he    9506         be   6672
of   34375         unto  8929         is   6595
to   13352         I     8699         with 5949
And  12734         his   8352         not  5840
that 12428         a     7940         all  5238
in   12154         for   7139         thou 4629
</PRE></TT></DL>
Almost eight percent of the 789,616 words in the text
were the word ``the''
(as opposed to 16 percent of the words in this sentence).
By our definition of word,
``and'' and ``And'' have two separate counts.

<p>
<a href="wordfreqs.html">[Click for more examples of
word frequency counts.]</a>

<p>
These counts were produced by the following C++ program,
which uses the Standard Template Library
<i>map</i> to associate an integer count with each string: 
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
int main(void)
{   map<string, int> M;
    map<string, int>::iterator j;
    string t;
    while (cin >> t)
        M[t]++;
    for (j = M.begin(); j != M.end(); ++j)
        cout << j->first << " " << j->second << "\n";
    return 0;
}
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>while</i> statement inserts each word <i>t</i>
into the map <i>M</i> and increments the associated counter
(which is initialized to zero at initialization).
The <i>for</i> statement iterates through the words in
sorted order and prints each word
(<i>first</i>) and its count (<i>second</i>).

<p>
This C++ code is straightforward, succinct
and surprisingly fast.
On my machine,
it takes 7.6 seconds to process the Bible.
About 2.4 seconds go to reading,
4.9 seconds to the insertions,
and 0.3 seconds to writing the ouput.

<p>
We can reduce the processing time by
building our own hash table,
using nodes that contain a pointer to a word,
a count of how often the word has been seen,
and a pointer to the next node in the table.
Here is the hash table after inserting the strings
``in'', ``the'' and ``in'',
in the unlikely event that both strings hash to 1:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="hash table" ALIGN=center src="hashtab.jpg">
<br>
We'll implement the hash table with this C structure:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
typedef struct node *nodeptr;
typedef struct node {
    char *word;
    int count;
    nodeptr next;
} node;
</PRE></TT></DL>

<p>
Even by our loose definition of ``word'',
the Bible has only 29,131 distinct words.
We'll follow the old lore of using a prime number
near that for our hash table size,
and the popular multiplier of 31:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
#define NHASH 29989
#define MULT 31
nodeptr bin[NHASH];
</PRE></TT></DL>
Our hash function maps a string to a positive integer
less than <i>NHASH</i>:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
unsigned int hash(char *p)
    unsigned int h = 0
    for ( ; *p; p++)
        h = MULT * h + *p
    return h % NHASH
</PRE></TT></DL>
Using <i>unsigned</i> integers ensures that <i>h</i> remains positive.

<p>
The <i>main</i> function initializes every bin to <i>NULL</i>,
reads the word and increments the count of each,
then iterates through the hash table to write
the (unsorted) words and counts:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
int main(void)
    for i = [0, NHASH)
        bin[i] = NULL
    while scanf("%s", buf) != EOF
        incword(buf)
    for i = [0, NHASH)
        for (p = bin[i]; p != NULL; p = p->next)
            print p->word, p->count
    return 0
</PRE></TT></DL>
The work is done by <i>incword</i>, which increments
the count associated with the input word
(and initializes it if it is not already there):
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
void incword(char *s)
    h = hash(s)
    for (p = bin[h]; p != NULL; p = p->next)
        if strcmp(s, p->word) == 0
            (p->count)++
            return
    p = malloc(sizeof(hashnode))
    p->count = 1
    p->word = malloc(strlen(s)+1)
    strcpy(p->word, s)
    p->next = bin[h]
    bin[h] = p
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>for</i> loop looks at every node with the
same hash value.
If the word is found,
its count is incremented and the function returns.
If the word is not found,
the function makes a new node,
allocates space and copies the string
(experienced C programmers would use <i>strdup</i> for the task),
and inserts the node at the front of the list.

<p>
This C program takes about 2.4 seconds to read its input
(the same as the C++ version),
but only 0.5 seconds for the insertions
(down from 4.9)
and only 0.06 seconds to write the output
(down from 0.3).
The complete run time is 3.0 seconds (down from 7.6),
and the processing time is 0.55 seconds (down from 5.2).
Our custom-made hash table (in 30 lines of C)
is an order of magnitude faster than
the maps from the C++ Standard Template Library.

<p>
This little exercise illustrates the two main ways
to represent sets of words.
Balanced search trees operate on strings as
indivisible objects;
these structures are used in most
implementations of the STL's <i>set</i>s and <i>map</i>s.
They always keep the elements in sorted order,
so they can efficiently perform operations such
as finding a predecessor or reporting the elements in order.
Hashing, on the other hand,
peeks inside the characters to compute a hash function,
and then scatters keys across a big table.
It is very fast on the average,
but it does not offer the worst-case performance
guarantees of balanced trees,
or support other operations involving order.
