This little exercise has only skimmed the fascinating topic
of specifying a program.
For a deep insight into this crucial activity,
see Michael Jackson's
<i>Software Requirements & Specifications</i>,
published by Addison-Wesley in 1995.
The tough topics in the book are presented as
a delightful collection of independent
but reinforcing little essays.

In the case study described in this column,
the programmer's main problem
was not so much technical as psychological:
he couldn't make progress because he was trying to solve
the wrong problem.
We finally solved his problem by breaking through
his conceptual block and solving an easier problem.
<i>Conceptual Blockbusting</i>
by James L. Adams
(the third edition was published by Perseus in 1986)
studies this kind of leap and is generally a pleasant prod
towards more creative thinking.
Although it was not written with programmers in mind,
many of its lessons are particularly appropriate for
programming problems.
Adams defines conceptual blocks as ``mental walls that block
the problem-solver from correctly perceiving a problem
or conceiving its solution'';
