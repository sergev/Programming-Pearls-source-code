<h4>Web Reviews</h4>

<p>
I talked about how much I enjoyed the first edition
when I described
<a href="why2e.html">why I wrote a second edition</a>.
Other people like the book, too.

<p>
<a href="http://www.construx.com/stevemcc/">Steve McConnell</a>
put <i>Programming Pearls</i>
on the
<a href="http://www.construx.com/stevemcc/cclib.htm">
Top-Ten List</a>
in his
<a href="http://www.construx.com/stevemcc/cc.htm"><i>Code Complete</i></a>.
He says that the book is ``a vigorous discussion of
programming that articulates the reasons that some of us
find programming so interesting.
The fact that the information isn't comprehensive or rigidly organized
doesn't prevent it from conveying powerful insights that you'll
read in a few minutes and use for many years.''

In an
<a href="http://www.accu.org/index.htm">
Association of C and C++ Users</a>
<a href="http://www.accu.org/bookreviews/public/reviews/p/p001056.htm">
Book Review</a>
Francis Glassborow says that it
``is another of those rare computing books
that manages to stand the test of time''
and that
``it has a place on every programmer's bookshelf''.

The book is also described in Ray Duncan's

Confessions of an Efficient Coder</a>
in the same series.

<p>
The first edition of <i>Programming Pearls</i> earned five stars at

<p>
``The mentoring system?
Actually, that's not broken....
There are certain things,
certain algorithmic techniques and things.
But give the guy a copy of <i>Programming Pearls</i>,
make sure he's read through the thing and understands
everything in there.
Show him a piece of code.
Ask him some questions about it....''
