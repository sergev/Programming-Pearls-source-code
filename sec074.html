Most back-of-the-envelope calculations use
obvious rules:
total cost is unit cost times number of units.
Sometimes, though, one needs a more subtle insight.
Bruce Weide
wrote the following note about a surprisingly versatile rule.

<P>
``The `operational analysis' introduced by Denning and Buzen (see
<i>Computing Surveys 10</i>,
3, November 1978, 225-261) is much more general than
queueing network models of computer systems.
Their exposition is excellent, but
because of the article's limited focus,
they didn't explore the generality of Little's Law.
The proof methods have nothing to do with queues
or with computer systems.
Imagine <i>any</i> system in which things enter and leave.
Little's Law states that
`The average number of things in the system
is the product of the average rate at which things leave
the system and the average time each one spends in the system.'
(And if there is a gross `flow balance' of things entering and
leaving, the exit rate is also the entry rate.)

<p>
``I teach this technique of performance analysis in my
computer architecture classes at Ohio State University.
But I try to emphasize that the result is a general law of systems
theory, and can be applied to many other kinds of systems.
For instance, if you're in line waiting to get into a popular
nightspot, you might figure out how long you'll have to
wait by standing there for a while and trying to estimate
the rate at which people are entering.
With Little's Law, though, you could reason,
`This place holds about 60 people,
and the average Joe will be in there about 3 hours,
so we're entering at the rate of about 20 people an hour.
The line has 20 people in it,
so that means we'll wait about an hour.
Let's go home and read
<i>Programming Pearls</i>
instead.'
You get the picture.''

<P>
Peter Denning
succinctly phrases this rule as
``The average number of objects in a queue is the product of the
entry rate and the average holding time.''
He applies it to his wine cellar:
``I have 150 cases of wine in my basement and I consume
(and purchase) 25 cases per year.
How long do I hold each case?
Little's Law tells me to divide 150 cases
by 25 cases/year, which gives 6 years per case.''

<P>
He then turns to more serious applications.
``The response-time formula for a multi-user system can be proved
using Little's Law and flow balance.
Assume <i>n</i> users of average think time <i>z</i> are connected
to an arbitrary system with response time <i>r</i>.
Each user cycles between thinking and waiting-for-response,
so the total number of jobs in the meta-system
(consisting of users and the computer system)
is fixed at <i>n</i>.
If you cut the path from the system's output to the users,
you see a meta-system with average load <i>n</i>,
average response time <i>z</i>+<i>r</i>,
and throughput <i>x</i> (measured in jobs per time unit).
Little's Law says <i>n</i> = <i>x</i>*(<i>z</i>+<i>r</i>),
and solving for <i>r</i> gives <i>r</i> = <i>n</i>/<i>x</i> - <i>z</i>.''
