<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font>)
</h1>

<P>
These five columns review the basics of programming.
<a href="cto.html">Column 1</a>
is the history of a single problem.
A combination of careful problem definition
and straightforward programming techniques
led to an elegant solution.
The case illustrates the central theme of this book:
thinking hard about a real case study
can be fun and can also lead to practical benefits.

<P>
<a href="sketch02.html">Column 2</a>
examines three problems,
with an emphasis on how algorithmic
insights can yield simple and effective code.
Column 3 surveys the crucial role
that the structure of data can play in software design.

<P>
<a href="sketch04.html">Column 4</a>
introduces program verification
as a tool for writing correct code.
Verification techniques are used extensively
as we derive subtle (and fast) functions
in Columns 9, 11 and 14.
<a href="sketch05.html">Column 5</a>
shows how we implement those abstract
programs in real code,
using scaffolding to probe a function,
to bombard it with test cases,
and to measure its performance.
