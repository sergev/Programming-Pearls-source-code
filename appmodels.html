<h1>Cost Models for Time and Space
<br>(Appendix 3 of
<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font>)
</h1>


<P>
<a href="sec072.html">Section 7.2</a>
describes two little programs
for estimating the time and space consumed
by various primitive operations.
This appendix shows how those can grow into
useful programs for generating one-page time
and space estimates.
The complete source code for both programs
can be found at this book's web site.

<P>
The program <a href="spacemod.cpp">spacemod.cpp</a> produces a
model of the space consumed by various constructs
in C++.
The first part of the program uses a sequence
of statements like
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
cout << "sizeof(char)=" << sizeof(char);
cout << " sizeof(short)=" << sizeof(short);
</PRE></TT></DL>
to give precise measurements of primitive objects:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
sizeof(char)=1  sizeof(short)=2  sizeof(int)=4
sizeof(float)=4  sizeof(struct *)=4  sizeof(long)=4
sizeof(double)=8
</PRE></TT></DL>

<P>
The program also defines a dozen structures,
using the simple naming convention illustrated
in these examples:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
struct structc { char c; };
struct structic { int i; char c; };
struct structip { int i; structip *p; };
struct structdc { double d; char c; };
struct structc12 { char c[12]; };
</PRE></TT></DL>
The program uses a macro to report the
<i>sizeof</i> the structure,
and then to estimate the number of bytes that
<i>new</i> allocates in a report like this:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
structc    1   48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48
structic   8   48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48
structip   8   48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48
structdc   16  64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
structcd   16  64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
structcdc  24  -3744 4096 64 64 64 64 64 64 64 64
structiii  12  48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48 48
</PRE></TT></DL>
The first number is given by <i>sizeof</i>,
and the next ten numbers report the differences
between successive pointers returned by <i>new</i>.
This output is typical:
most of the numbers are quite consistent,
but the allocator skips around every now and then.

<P>
This macro makes one line of the report:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
#define MEASURE(T, text) {                \
    cout << text << "\t";                 \
    cout << sizeof(T) << "\t";            \
    int lastp = 0;                        \
    for (int i = 0; i < 11; i++) {        \
        T *p = new T;                     \
        int thisp = (int) p;              \
        if (lastp != 0)                   \
            cout << " " << thisp - lastp; \
        lastp = thisp;                    \
    }                                     \
    cout << "\n";                         \
}
</PRE></TT></DL>
The macro is called with the structure name
followed by the same name in quotes,
so it can be printed: 
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
MEASURE(structc, "structc");
</PRE></TT></DL>
(My first draft used a C++ template
parameterized by structure type,
but measurements were led wildly astray by
artifacts of the C++ implementation.)

<P>
This table summarizes the output of the program on my machine:
<br>

</TBODY>
</TABLE>

The left column of numbers helps us to estimate
the <i>sizeof</i> structures.
We start by summing the <i>sizeof</i> the types;
that explains the 8 bytes for <i>structip</i>.
We must also account for the alignment;
although its components sum to 10 bytes
(two <i>char</i>s and a <i>double</i>),
<i>structcdc</i> consumes 24 bytes.

<P>
The right column gives us insight into the space overhead
of the <i>new</i> operator.
It appears that any structure with a <i>sizeof</i> 12 bytes
or less will consume 48 bytes.
Structures with 13 through 28 bytes consume 64 bytes.
In general,
the allocated block size will be a multiple of 16,
with 36 to 47 bytes of overhead.
This is surprisingly expensive;
other systems that I use consume just 8 bytes of
overhead to represent an 8-byte record.

<P>
<a href="sec072.html">Section 7.2</a>
also describes a little program
for estimating the cost of one particular C operation.
We can generalize that to the
<a href="timemod.c">timemod.c</a>
program that produces
a one-page cost model for a set of C operations.
(Brian Kernighan, Chris Van Wyk and I built a
predecessor of this program in 1991.)
The <i>main</i> function of that program consists of
a sequence of a <i>T</i> (for title) lines
followed by <i>M</i> lines to measure the cost of operations:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
T("Integer Arithmetic");
M({});
M(k++);
M(k = i + j);
M(k = i - j);
    ...
</PRE></TT></DL>
Those lines (and a few more like them)
produce this output:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
Integer Arithmetic (n=5000)
 {}           250   261   250   250   251   10
 k++          471   460   471   461   460   19
 k = i + j    491   491   500   491   491   20
 k = i - j    440   441   441   440   441   18
 k = i * j    491   490   491   491   490   20
 k = i / j   2414  2433  2424  2423  2414   97
 k = i % j   2423  2414  2423  2414  2423   97
 k = i & j    491   491   480   491   491   20
 k = i | j    440   441   441   440   441   18
</PRE></TT></DL>
The first column gives the operation
that is executed inside the loop
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
for i = [1, n]
    for j = [1, n]
        op
</PRE></TT></DL>
The next five columns show the raw time
in clock clicks (milliseconds on this system)
for five executions of that loop
(these times are all consistent;
inconsistent numbers help to identify suspicious runs).
The final column gives the average cost
in nanoseconds per operation.
The first row of the table says that it takes
about ten nanoseconds to execute a loop that
contains the null operation.
The next row says that incrementing the variable <i>k</i>
consumes about 9 additional nanoseconds.
All of the arithmetic and logical operations have
about the same cost,
with the exception of the division and remainder operators,
which are an order-of-magnitude more expensive.

<P>
This approach gives rough estimates for my machine,
and they must not be over-interpreted.
I conducted all experiments with optimization disabled.
When I enabled that option,
the optimizer removed the entire timing loops
and all times were zero.

<P>
The work is done by the <i>M</i> macro,
which can be sketched in pseudocode as:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
#define M(op)
    print op as a string
    timesum = 0
    for trial = [0, trials)
        start = clock()
        for i = [1, n]
            fi = i
            for j = [1, n]
                op
        t = clock()-start
        print t
        timesum += t
    print 1e9*timesum / (n*n * trials * CLOCKS_PER_SEC)
</PRE></TT></DL>
The complete code for this cost model can be found
at this book's web site.

<P>
We'll now survey the output of the program
on my particular system.
Because the clock clicks are all consistent,
we will omit them and report only
the average time in nanoseconds.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
Floating Point Arithmetic (n=5000)
 fj=j;                 18
 fj=j; fk = fi + fj    26
 fj=j; fk = fi - fj    27
 fj=j; fk = fi * fj    24
 fj=j; fk = fi / fj    78
Array Operations (n=5000)
 k = i + j             17
 k = x[i] + j          18
 k = i + x[j]          24
 k = x[i] + x[j]       27
</PRE></TT></DL>
The floating point operations originally assign the
integer <i>j</i> to the floating-point <i>fj</i>
(in about 8 nanoseconds);
the outer loop assigns <i>i</i> to the floating-point <i>fi</i>.
The floating operations themselves cost about as much
as their integer counterparts,
and the array operations are equally inexpensive.

<P>
The next tests give us insight into control flow
in general and some sorting operations in particular:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
Comparisons (n=5000)
 if (i &lt; j) k++           20
 if (x[i] &lt; x[j]) k++     25
Array Comparisons and Swaps (n=5000)
 k = (x[i]&lt;x[k]) ? -1:1   34
 k = intcmp(x+i, x+j)     52
 swapmac(i, j)            41
 swapfunc(i, j)           65
</PRE></TT></DL>
The function versions of comparing and swapping
each cost about 20 nanoseconds more
than their inline counterparts.
Section 9.2 compares the cost of computing the
maximum of two values with functions, macros and inline code:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
Max Function, Macro and Inline (n=5000)
 k = (i > j) ? i : j   26
 k = maxmac(i, j)      26
 k = maxfunc(i, j)     54
</PRE></TT></DL>

<P>
The <i>rand</i> function is relatively inexpensive
(though recall that the <i>bigrand</i> function makes
two calls to <i>rand</i>),
square root is an order of magnitude greater than
basic arithmetic operations
(though only twice the cost of a division),
simple trigonometric operations cost twice that,
and advanced trigonometric operations run into microseconds.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
Math Functions (n=1000)
 k = rand()          40
 fk = j+fi           20
 fk = sqrt(j+fi)    188
 fk = sin(j+fi)     344
 fk = sinh(j+fi)   2229
 fk = asin(j+fi)    973
 fk = cos(j+fi)     353
 fk = tan(j+fi)     465
</PRE></TT></DL>
Because those are so pricey,
we shrunk the value of <i>n</i>.
Memory allocation is more expensive yet,
and merits an even smaller <i>n</i>:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
Memory Allocation (n=500)
 free(malloc(16))       2484
 free(malloc(100))      3044
 free(malloc(2000))     4959
</PRE></TT></DL>
