<h3>Interpretation</h3>

<p>
Please count how many of your ranges included
the correct answer.
Because you used a 90-percent confidence interval,
you should have gotten about nine of the ten answers correct.

<p>
If you had all ten answers correct,
then you may be an excellent estimator.
Then again,
your ranges may be way too big.
You can probably guess which.

<p>
If you had six or fewer answers correct,
then you are probably as embarrassed as I was when
I first took a similar estimation quiz.
A little practice couldn't hurt your estimation skills.

<p>
If you had seven or eight answers correct,
then you are a pretty good guesser.
In the future,
remember to broaden your 90-percent ranges just a bit.

<p>
If you had exactly nine answers correct,
then you may be an excellent guesser.
Or, you may have given infinite ranges for the
first nine questions,
and zero for the last question.
If so, shame on you.
