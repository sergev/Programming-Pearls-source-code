Viewed in this light, the <i>bitmap</i>
<i>bit vector</i>
representation of a set screams out to be used.
We can represent a toy set of nonnegative integers less than 20
by a string of 20 bits.
For instance,
we can store the set {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13}
in this string:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
</PRE></TT></DL>
The bits representing numbers in the set are 1,
and all other bits are 0.

<p>
In the real problem,
the seven decimal digits of each integer
denote a number less than ten million.
We'll represent the file by a string of
ten million bits in which the <i>i</i><sup>th</sup>
bit is on if and only if the integer <i>i</i> is in the file.
(The programmer found two million spare bits;
Problem
<a href="sec016.html#p5">5</a>
investigates what happens when
a megabyte is a firm limit.)
This representation uses three attributes of this
problem not usually found in sorting problems:
the input is from a relatively small range,
it contains no duplicates,
and no data is associated with each record
beyond the single integer.

<p>
Given the bitmap
data structure to represent the set of integers in the file,
the program can be written in three natural phases.
The first phase 
initializes the set to empty by turning off all bits.
The second phase builds the set by reading each integer in the
file and turning on the appropriate bit.
The third phase
produces the sorted output file by inspecting each bit and
writing out the appropriate integer if the bit is one.
If <i>n</i> is the number of bits in the vector
(in this case 10,000,000), the program can be expressed in
pseudocode as:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
/* phase 1: initialize set to empty */
    for i = [0, n)
        bit[i] = 0
/* phase 2: insert present elements into the set */
    for each i in the input file
        bit[i] = 1
/* phase 3: write sorted output */
    for i = [0, n)
        if bit[i] == 1
            write i on the output file
</PRE></TT></DL>
(Recall from the
<a href="preface.html#pseudocode">preface</a>
that the notation
<i>for i = [0, n)</i>
iterates <i>i</i> from 0 to <i>n</i>-1.)

<p>
This sketch was sufficient for the programmer
to solve his problem.
Some of the implementation details he faced
are described in Problems
<a href="sec016.html#p2">2</a>,
<a href="sec016.html#p5">5</a>
and
<a href="sec016.html#p7">7</a>.
