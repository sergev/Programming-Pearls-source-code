<h1>An Estimation Quiz
<br>(Appendix 2 of
<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font>)
</h1>

<P>
Back-of-the-envelope calculations
all start with basic quantities.
Those numbers can sometimes be found
in a problem specification
(such as a requirements document),
but other times they must be estimated.

<P>
This little quiz is designed to help you evaluate
your proficency as a number guesser.
For each question,
fill in upper and lower bounds that,
<i>in your opinion</i>,
give you a ninety percent chance of including the true value;
try not to make your ranges too narrow or too wide.
I estimate that it should take you between five and
ten minutes.
Please make a good faith effort.
