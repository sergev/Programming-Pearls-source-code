The programmer's question was simple:
``How do I sort a disk file?''
Before I tell you how I made my first mistake,
let me give you a chance to do better than I did.
What would you have said?

<h3>1.1 A Friendly Conversation</h3>

<p>
My mistake was to answer his question.
I gave him a thumbnail sketch of how to
implement a Merge Sort on disk.
My suggestion that he dig into an algorithms text
met with less than
enthusiasm -- he was more concerned about 
solving the problem than furthering his education.
I then told him about a disk sorting program in
a popular programming book.
The program consisted of about two hundred lines
of code in a dozen functions;
I estimated that implementing and testing the code
would have taken the programmer at most a week.

<p>
I thought that I had solved his problem, but his
hesitation led me back to the right track.
The conversation then went something like this, with
my questions in <i>italics</i>.
<DL>
<DT><DD>
<i>
Why do you want to write your own sort at all?
Why not use a sort provided by your system?
</i>
<br><br><DT><DD>
I need the sort in the middle of a large system,
and for obscure technical reasons,
I can't use the system file-sorting program.
<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>
What exactly are you sorting?
How many records are in the file?
What is the format of each record?
</i>
<br><br><DT><DD>
The file contains at most ten million records;
each record is a seven-digit integer.
<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>
Wait a minute.
If the file is that small, why bother going to disk at all?
Why not just sort it in main memory?
</i>
<br><br><DT><DD>
Although the machine has many megabytes of main memory,
this function is part of a big system.
I expect that I'll have only about a megabyte
free at that point.
<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>
Is there anything else you can tell me about the records?
</i>
<br><br><DT><DD>
Each one is a seven-digit positive integer
with no other associated data,
and no integer can appear more than once.
</DL>

<p>
The context makes the problem clearer.
In the United States,
telephone numbers consist of a three-digit ``area code''
followed by seven additional digits.
Telephone calls to numbers with the ``toll-free''
area code of 800 (the only such code at the time) were not charged.
A real database of toll-free telephone numbers includes
a great deal of information:
the toll-free telephone number,
the real number to which calls are routed
(sometimes several numbers,
with rules on which calls go where when),
the name and address of the subscriber, and so on.

<p>
The programmer was building a small corner of
a system for processing such a database,
and the integers to be sorted were toll-free telephone numbers.
The input file was a list of numbers
(with all other information removed),
and it was an error to include the same number twice.
The desired output was a file of the numbers,
sorted in increasing numeric order.
The context also defines the performance requirements.
During a long session with the system,
the user requested a sorted file roughly
once an hour and could do nothing until the sort was completed.
The sort therefore couldn't take more than a few minutes,
while ten seconds was a more desirable run time.
