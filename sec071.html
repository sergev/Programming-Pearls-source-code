<i>Two Answers Are Better Than One.</i>
When I asked Peter Weinberger how much water flows out of
the Mississippi per day,
he responded, ``As much as flows in.''
He then estimated that the Mississippi basin
was about 1000 by 1000 miles,
and that the annual runoff from rainfall
there was about one foot
(or one five-thousandth of a mile).
That gives
<small>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1000 miles * 1000 miles * 1/5000 mile/year
&nbsp;~&nbsp;
200 miles<sup>3</sup>/year
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(200 miles<sup>3</sup>/year) / (400 days/year)
&nbsp;~&nbsp;
1/2 mile<sup>3</sup>/day
</small>
<br>
or a little more than half a cubic mile per day.
It's important to double check all calculations,
and especially so for quick ones.


<p>
As a cheating triple check,
an almanac reported that the river's
discharge is 640,000 cubic feet per second.
Working from that gives

<small>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
640,000ft<sup>3</sup>/sec * 3600 secs/hr
&nbsp;~&nbsp;
2.3x10<sup>9</sup>ft<sup>3</sup> / hr

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2.3x10<sup>9</sup>ft<sup>3</sup>/hr * 24hrs/day
&nbsp;~&nbsp;
6x10<sup>10</sup>ft<sup>3</sup>/day

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6x10<sup>10</sup>ft<sup>3</sup>/day  / (5000ft/mile)<sup>3</sup>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~
6x10<sup>10</sup>ft<sup>3</sup>/day /
(125x10<sup>9</sup>ft<sup>3</sup>/mile<sup>3</sup>)

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~
60/125 mile<sup>3</sup>/day

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~
1/2 mile<sup>3</sup>/day
</small>
<br>
The proximity of the two estimates to one another,
and especially to the almanac's answer,
is a fine example of sheer dumb luck.


<P>
<i>Quick Checks.</i>
Polya devotes three pages of his
<i>How to Solve It</i>
to ``Test by Dimension'', which he describes as a
``well-known, quick and efficient means to check
geometrical or physical formulas''.
The first rule is that the dimensions in a sum must be the same,
which is in turn the dimension of the sum -- you
can add feet together to get feet,
but you can't add seconds to pounds.
The second rule is that the dimension of a product is the
product of the dimensions.
The examples above obey both rules;
multiplying
<small>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(miles + miles) x miles x miles / day
&nbsp;~&nbsp;
miles<sup>3</sup>/day
</small>
<br>
has the right form, apart from any constants.

<P>
A simple table can help you keep track of dimensions
in complicated expressions like those above.
To perform Weinberger's calculation,
we first write down the three original factors.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="formula 1" ALIGN=center src="misstab1.jpg">
<br>
Next we simplify the expression by cancelling terms,
which shows that the output is 200 miles<sup>3</sup>/year.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="formula 2" ALIGN=center src="misstab2.jpg">
<br>
Now we multiply by the identity (well, almost)
that there are 400 days per year.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="formula 3" ALIGN=center src="misstab3.jpg">
<br>
Cancellation yields the (by now familiar)
answer of half a cubic mile per day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img alt="formula 4" ALIGN=center src="misstab4.jpg">
<br>
These tabular calculations help you keep track of dimensions.

<P>
Dimension tests check the form of equations.
Check your multiplications and divisions with an old
trick from slide rule days:
independently compute the leading digit and the exponent.
One can make several quick checks for addition.
<small>
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
 3142        3142        3142
 2718        2718        2718	
<u>+1123</u>       <u>+1123</u>       <u>+1123</u>
  983        6982        6973
</PRE></TT></DL>

The first sum has too few digits and the second sum errs
in the least significant digit.
The technique of ``casting out nines''
reveals the error in the third example:
the digits in the summands sum to 8 modulo 9,
while those in the answer sum to 7 modulo 9.
In a correct addition, the sums of the digits
are equal after ``casting out'' groups of digits
that sum to nine.

<P>
Above all, don't forget common sense:
be suspicious of any calculations that show
that the Mississippi River discharges 100
gallons of water per day.

<P>
<i>Rules of Thumb.</i>
I first learned the ``Rule of 72'' in a course
on accounting.
Assume that you invest a sum of money for
<i>y</i> years at an interest rate of <i>r</i> percent per year.
The financial version of the rule says that if
<i>r times y = 72</i>,
then your money will roughly double.
The approximation is quite accurate:
investing $1000 at 6 percent interest
for 12 years gives $2,012,
and $1000 at 8 percent for 9 years gives $1,999.

<P>
The Rule of 72 is handy for estimating the growth of any
exponential process.
If a bacterial colony in a dish grows
at the rate of three percent per hour,
then it doubles in size every day.
And doubling brings programmers back to
familiar rules of thumb:
because 2<sup>10</sup>=1024,
ten doublings is about a thousand,
twenty doublings is about a million,
and thirty doublings is about a billion.

<P>
Suppose that an exponential program
takes ten seconds to solve a problem of size <i>n</i>=40,
and that increasing <i>n</i> by one
increases the run time by 12 percent
(we probably learned this by
plotting its growth on a logarithmic scale).
The Rule of 72 tells us that the run time doubles
when <i>n</i> increases by 6,
or goes up by a factor of about 1000 when <i>n</i> increases by 60.
When <i>n</i>=100,
the program should therefore take about 10,000 seconds,
or a few hours.
But what happens when <i>n</i> increases to 160,
and the time rises to 10<sup>7</sup> seconds?
How much time is that?

<P>
You might find it hard to memorize that there are
3.155x10<sup>7</sup> seconds in a year.
On the other hand, it is hard to forget
Tom Duff's handy rule of thumb that,
to within half a percent,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Pi seconds is a nanocentury.</i>
<br>
Because the exponential program takes 10<sup>7</sup> seconds,
we should be prepared to wait about four months.

<P>
<i>Practice.</i>
As with many activities,
your estimation skills can only be improved with practice.
Try the problems at the end of this column,
and the estimation quiz in
<a href="quiz.html">Appendix 2</a>
(a similar quiz once gave me a much-needed dose of
humility about my estimation prowess).
<a href="sec078.html">Section 7.8</a>
describes quick calculations in everyday life.
Most workplaces provide ample opportunities for
back-of-the-envelope estimates.
How many foam ``packing peanuts'' came in that box?
How much time do people at your facility spend
waiting in line every day,
for morning coffee, lunch, photocopiers and the like?
How much does that cost the company in (loaded) salary?
And the next time you're
<i>really</i>
bored at the lunch table,
ask your colleagues how much water flows out of the
Mississippi River each day.
