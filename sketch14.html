<h1>Heaps
<br>(A Sketch of Column 14 of
<font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font>)
</h1>

<P>
This column is about ``heaps'',
a data structure that we'll use to solve two
important problems.
<DL>
<DT><DD>
<i>Sorting</i>.
Heapsort never takes more than O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) time
to sort an <i>n</i>-element array, 
and uses just a few words of extra space.
<DT><DD>
<i>Priority Queues</i>.
Heaps maintain a set of elements under the operations
of inserting new elements and
extracting the smallest element in the set;
each operation requires O(log  <i>n</i>) time.
</DL>
For both problems,
heaps are simple to code and computationally efficient.

<p>
This column has a bottom-up organization:
we start at the details and work up to the big picture.
The next two sections describe the heap data structure and
two functions to operate on it.
The two subsequent sections use those tools
to solve the problems mentioned above.


<h3>The Rest of the Column</h3>

<br>14.1 The Data Structure
<br>14.2 Two Critical Functions
<br>14.3 Priority Queues
<br>14.4 A Sorting Algorithm
<br>14.5 Principles
<br>14.6 Problems

<P>
The <a href="teaching.html">teaching material</a>
contains overhead transparencies based on this column;
the slides are available in both
<a href="s14.ps">Postscript</a>
and
<a href="s14.pdf">Acrobat</a>.

<P>
The <a href="code.html#col14">code for Column 14</a>
contains the code for priority queues,
and the <a href="code.html#col11">code for Column 11</a>
contains the code for Heapsort.

<P>
The <a href="sortanim.html">animations of sorting algorithms</a>
show Heapsort at work.
(But heed the warning on that page that the sleazy
implementation leaves the first element of the array
dangling in mid-air.)
