<h1>Phrases
<br>(Section 15.2 of
<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font>)
</h1>

<p>
Words are the basic component of documents,
and many important problems can be solved by
searching for words.
Sometimes, however,
I search long strings
(my documents, or help files, or web pages,
or even the entire web)
for phrases,
such as ``substring searching'' or
``implicit data structures''.

<p>
How would you search through a large body of text
to find ``a phrase of several words''?
If you had never seen the body of text before,
you would have no choice but to start at the beginning
and scan through the whole input;
most algorithms texts describe many approaches to this
``substring searching problem''.

<p>
Suppose, though,
that you had a chance to preprocess the body of
text before performing searches.
You could make a hash table (or search tree)
to index every distinct word of the document,
and store a list of every occurrence of each word.
Such an ``inverted index'' allows a program to
look up a given word quickly.
One can look up phrases by intersecting the
lists of the words they contain,
but this is subtle to implement and potentially slow.
(<a href="http://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/SRC/publications/sites/talk/AltaVista_Technical-abs.html">Some web search engines</a>
do, however,
take exactly this approach.)

<p>
We'll turn now to a powerful data structure
and apply it to a small problem:
given an input file of text,
find the longest duplicated substring of characters in it.
For instance, the longest repeated string in
``Ask not what your country can do for you,
but what you can do for your country''
is `` can do for you'',
with `` your country'' a close second place.
How would you write a program to solve this problem?

<p>

long repeated strings]</a>

<p>
This problem is reminiscent of the anagram
problem that we saw in Section 2.4.
If the input string is stored in <i>c[0..n-1]</i>,
then we could start by comparing every pair of substrings
using pseudocode like this
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
maxlen = -1
for i = [0, n)
    for j = (i, n)
        if (thislen = comlen(&c[i], &c[j])) > maxlen
            maxlen = thislen
            maxi = i
            maxj = j
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>comlen</i> function returns the length that its two
parameter strings have in common,
starting with their first characters:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
int comlen(char *p, char *q)
    i = 0
    while *p && (*p++ == *q++)
        i++
    return i
</PRE></TT></DL>
Because this algorithm looks at all pairs of substrings,
it takes time proportional to <i>n</i><sup>2</sup>, at least.
We might be able to speed it up by using a hash table
to search for words in the phrases,
but we'll instead take an entirely new approach.

<p>
Our program will process at most <i>MAXN</i> characters,
which it stores in the array <i>c</i>:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
#define MAXN 5000000
char c[MAXN], *a[MAXN];
</PRE></TT></DL>
We'll use a simple data structure known as a ``suffix array'';
the structure has been used at least since the 1970's,
though the term was introduced in the 1990's.
The structure is an array <i>a</i> of pointers to characters.
As we read the input,
we initialize <i>a</i> so that each element points to the
corresponding character in the input string:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
while (ch = getchar()) != EOF
    a[n] = &c[n]
    c[n++] = ch
c[n] = 0
</PRE></TT></DL>
The final element of <i>c</i> contains a null character,
which terminates all strings.

<p>
The element <i>a[0]</i> points to the entire string;
the next element points to the suffix of the array
beginning with the second character, and so on.
On the input string ``banana'',
the array will represent these suffixes:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
a[0]: banana
a[1]: anana
a[2]: nana
a[3]: ana
a[4]: na
a[5]: a
</PRE></TT></DL>
The pointers in the array <i>a</i> together point to every
suffix in the string,
hence the name ``suffix array''.

<p>
If a long string occurs twice in the array <i>c</i>,
it appears in two different suffixes.
We will therefore sort the array to bring together
equal suffixes
(just as sorting brought together anagrams in Section 2.4).
The ``banana'' array sorts to
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
a[0]: a
a[1]: ana
a[2]: anana
a[3]: banana
a[4]: na
a[5]: nana
</PRE></TT></DL>
We can then scan through this array comparing adjacent
elements to find the longest repeated string,
which in this case is ``ana''.

<p>
We'll sort the suffix array with the <i>qsort</i> function:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
qsort(a, n, sizeof(char *), pstrcmp)
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>pstrcmp</i> comparison function adds one level of
indirection to the library <i>strcmp</i> function.
This scan through the array uses the <i>comlen</i> function
to count the number of letters
that two adjacent words have in common:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
for i = [0, n)
    if comlen(a[i], a[i+1]) > maxlen
        maxlen = comlen(a[i], a[i+1])
        maxi = i
printf("%.*s\n", maxlen, a[maxi])
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>printf</i> statement uses the ``*'' precision
to print <i>maxlen</i> characters of the string.

<p>
<a name="longdupexample">
I ran
<a href="longdup.c">the resulting program</a>
to find the longest repeated string in the 807,503 characters in
Samuel Butler's translation of Homer's
<i>Iliad</i>.
The program took 4.8 seconds to locate this string:
<DL><DT><DD>
whose sake so many of the Achaeans have
died at Troy, far from their homes?
Go about at once among the host,
and speak fairly to them, man by man,
that they draw not their ships into the sea.
</DL>
The text first occurs when Juno suggests it
to Minerva as an argument that might keep
the Greeks (Achaeans) from departing from Troy;
it occurs shortly thereafter when Minerva
repeats the argument verbatim to Ulysses.
On this and other typical text files of <i>n</i> characters,
the algorithm runs in O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) time,
due to sorting.

<p>
Suffix arrays represent every substring in
</i>n</i> characters of input text using the text itself
and <i>n</i> additional pointers.
Problem
<a href="sec155.html#p6">6</a>
investigates how suffix arrays
can be used to solve the substring searching problem.
We'll turn now to a more subtle application of suffix arrays.
