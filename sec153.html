<h1>Generating Text

<p>
How can you generate random text?
A classic approach is to let loose
that poor monkey on his aging typewriter.
If the beast is equally likely to hit any
lower case letter or the space bar,
the output might look like this:
<DL><DT><DD>
uzlpcbizdmddk njsdzyyvfgxbgjjgbtsak rqvpgnsbyputvqqdtmgltz
ynqotqigexjumqphujcfwn ll jiexpyqzgsdllgcoluphl
sefsrvqqytjakmav bfusvirsjl wprwqt
</DL>
This is pretty unconvincing English text.

<p>
If you count the letters in word games
(like Scrabble or Boggle),
you will notice that there are different numbers
of the various letters.
There are many more A's, for instance,
than there are Z's.
A monkey could produce more convincing text
by counting the letters in a document --
if A occurs 300 times in the text
while B occurs just 100 times, then the monkey should be 3 times more likely to type an A than a B.
This takes us a small step closer to English:
<DL><DT><DD>
saade ve mw hc n entt da k eethetocusosselalwo gx
fgrsnoh,tvettaf aetnlbilo fc lhd okleutsndyeoshtbogo
eet ib nheaoopefni ngent
</DL>

<p>
Most events occur in context.
Suppose that we wanted to generate randomly
a year's worth of Fahrenheit temperature data.
A series of 365 random integers between 0 and 100
wouldn't fool the average observer.
We could be more convincing by making today's temperature
a (random) function of yesterday's temperature:
if it is 85 degrees today, it is unlikely to be 15 degrees tomorrow.

<p>
The same is true of English words:
if this letter is a Q,
then the next letter is quite likely to be a U.
A generator can make more interesting text by making
each letter a random function of its predecessor.
We could, therefore,
read a sample text and count
how many times every letter follows an A,
how many times they follow a B,
and so on for each letter of the alphabet.
When we write the random text,
we produce the next letter
as a random function of the current letter.
The ``order-1'' text was made by exactly this scheme:
<a name="letterexamples">
<DL>

<DT><DD>
<i>Order-1:</i>
t I amy, vin. id wht omanly heay atuss
n macon aresethe hired boutwhe t, tl, ad torurest t plur I wit

<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>Order-2:</i>

"Yould," "I that vide was nots ther.

<i>Order-4:</i>

That it on of the who difficentralia.
He rushed likely?" "Blood night that.
</DL>

<p>

letter-level Markov text]</a>

<p>
We can extend this idea to longer sequences of letters.
The order-2 text was made by generating each
letter as a function of the two letters preceding it
(a letter pair is often called a digram).
The digram TH, for instance, is often followed in English by
the vowels A, E, I, O, U and Y, less frequently by R and W,
and rarely by other letters.
The order-3 text is built by choosing the next letter
as a function of the three previous letters (a trigram).
By the time we get to the order-4 text,
most words are English,
and you might not be surprised to learn that it was
generated from a Sherlock Holmes story
(``The Adventure of Abbey Grange'').
A classically educated reader of a draft of this column
commented that this sequence of fragments
reminded him of the evolution from
Old English to Victorian English.

<p>
Readers with a mathematical background might recognize
this process as a Markov chain.
One state represents each <i>k</i>-gram,
and the odds of going from one to another don't change,
so this is a
``finite-state Markov chain with
stationary transition probabilities''.

<p>
We can also generate random text at the word level.
The dumbest approach is to spew forth the words in
a dictionary at random.
A slightly better approach reads a document,
counts each word,
and then selects the next word to be printed
with the appropriate probability.
(The programs in 
<a href="sec151.html">Section 15.1</a>
use tools
appropriate for such tasks.)
We can get more interesting text,
though,
by using Markov chains that take into account
a few preceding words as they generate the next word.
Here is some random text produced after reading
a draft of the first 14 columns of this book:
<a name="wordexamples">

<i>Order-1:</i>
The table shows how many contexts; it uses
two or equal to the sparse matrices were not chosen.
In Section 13.1, for a more efficient that ``the more
time was published by calling recursive structure translates
to build scaffolding to try to know of selected and testing
and more robust and a binary search).

<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>Order-2:</i>
The program is guided by verification ideas,
and the second errs in the STL implementation
(which guarantees good worst-case performance),
and is especially rich in speedups due to Gordon Bell.
Everything should be to use a macro:
for <i>n=10,000</i>, its run time;
that point Martin picked up from his desk

<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>Order-3:</i>
A Quicksort would be quite efficient for
the main-memory sorts,
and it requires only a few distinct values
in this particular problem,
we can write them all down in the program,
and they were making progress towards a solution at a
snail's pace.
</DL>
The order-1 text is almost readable aloud,
while the order-3 text consists of very long phrases from the
original input,
with random transitions between them.
For purposes of parody, order-2 text is usually juiciest.

<a name="shannon">
I first saw letter-level and word-level
order-</i>k</i> approximations to English text
in Shannon's 1948 classic
<i>Mathematical Theory of Communication</i>.
Shannon writes,
``To construct [order-1 letter-level text] for example,
one opens a book at random and selects a letter
at random on the page.
This letter is recorded.
The book is then opened to another page and one reads until
this letter is encountered.
The succeeding letter is then recorded.
Turning to another page this second letter is searched for
and the succeeding letter recorded, etc.
A similar process was used for
[order-1 and order-2 letter-level text,
and order-0 and order-1 word-level text].
It would be interesting if further approximations
could be constructed,
but the labor involved becomes enormous at the next stage.''

<p>
A program can automate this laborious task.
Our C program to generate order-</i>k</i> Markov chains will store
at most five megabytes of text in the array <i>inputchars</i>:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
int k = 2;
char inputchars[5000000];
char *word[1000000];
int nword = 0;
</PRE></TT></DL>
<a href="markovlet.c">We could implement Shannon's algorithm directly</a>
by scanning through the complete input text to
generate each word
(though this might be slow on large texts).
We will instead employ the array <i>word</i> as
a kind of suffix array pointing to the characters,
except that it starts only on word boundaries
(a common modification).
The variable <i>nword</i> holds the number of words.
We read the file with this code:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
word[0] = inputchars
while scanf("%s", word[nword]) != EOF
    word[nword+1] = word[nword] + strlen(word[nword]) + 1
    nword++
</PRE></TT></DL>
Each word is appended to <i>inputchars</i>
(no other storage allocation is needed),
and is terminated by the null character
supplied by <i>scanf</i>.

<p>
After we read the input,
we will sort the <i>word</i> array
to bring together all pointers that 
point to the same sequence of <i>k</i> words.
This function does the comparisons:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
int wordncmp(char *p, char* q)
    n = k
    for ( ; *p == *q; p++, q++)
        if (*p == 0 && --n == 0)
            return 0
    return *p - *q
</PRE></TT></DL>
It scans through the two strings
while the characters are equal.
At every null character,
it decrements the counter <i>n</i> and returns equal after
seeing <i>k</i> identical words.
When it finds unequal characters,
it returns the difference.

<p>
After reading the input,
we append <i>k</i> null characters
(so the comparison function doesn't run off the end),
print the first <i>k</i> words in the document
(to start the random output),
and call the sort:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
for i = [0, k)
    word[nword][i] = 0
for i = [0, k)
    print word[i]
qsort(word, nword, sizeof(word[0]), sortcmp)
</PRE></TT></DL>
The <i>sortcmp</i> function,
as usual,
adds a level of indirection to its pointers.

<P>
Our space-efficient structure now contains
a great deal of information about the <i>k</i>-grams
in the text.
If <i>k</i> is 1 and the input text is
``of the people, by the people, for the people'',
the <i>word</i> array might look like this:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
word[0]: by the
word[1]: for the
word[2]: of the
word[3]: people
word[4]: people, for
word[5]: people, by
word[6]: the people,
word[7]: the people
word[8]: the people,
</PRE></TT></DL>
For clarity,
this picture shows only the first <i>k+1</i> words pointed
to by each element of <i>word</i>,
even though more words usually follow.
If we seek a word to follow the phrase ``the'',
we look it up in the suffix array to discover three choices:
``people,'' twice and ``people'' once.

<p>
We may now generate nonsense text with this pseudocode sketch:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
phrase = first phrase in input array
loop
    perform a binary search for phrase in word[0..nword-1]
    for all phrases equal in the first k words
        select one at random, pointed to by p
    phrase = word following p
    if k-th word of phrase is length 0
        break
    print k-th word of phrase
</PRE></TT></DL>
We initialize the loop by setting <i>phrase</i> to the
first characters in the input
(recall that those words were already printed on
the output file).
The binary search uses the code in Section 9.3
to locate the first occurrence of <i>phrase</i>
(it is crucial to find the very first occurrence;
the binary search of Section 9.3 does just this).
The next loop scans through all equal phrases,
and uses Solution 12.10
to select one of them at random.
If the <i>k</i>-th word of that phrase is of length zero,
the current phrase is the last in the document,
so we break the loop.

<p>
The complete pseudocode implements those ideas,
and also puts an upper bound on the
number of words it will generate:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
phrase = inputchars
for (wordsleft = 10000; wordsleft > 0; wordsleft--)
    l = -1
    u = nword
    while l+1 != u
        m = (l + u) / 2
        if wordncmp(word[m], phrase) < 0
            l = m
        else
            u = m
    for (i = 0; wordncmp(phrase, word[u+i]) == 0; i++)
        if rand() % (i+1) == 0
            p = word[u+i]
    phrase = skip(p, 1)
    if strlen(skip(phrase, k-1)) == 0
        break
    print skip(phrase, k-1)
</PRE></TT></DL>

Chapter 3 of
<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/bwk/">Kernighan</a> and
<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/rob/">Pike</a>'s
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/tpop/">
<i>Practice of Programming</i></a>
(described in Section 5.9)
is devoted to the general topic of ``Design and Implementation''.
They build their chapter around the problem of word-level
Markov-text generation because
``it is typical of many programs:
some data comes in, some data goes out,
and the processing depends on a little ingenuity.''
They give some interesting history of the problem,
and implement programs for the task in
C, Java, C++, Awk and Perl.

<p>
<a href="markov.c">The program in this section</a>
compares favorably with their C program for the task.
This code is about half the length of theirs;
representing a phrase by a pointer to <i>k</i> consecutive
words is space-efficient and easy to implement.
For inputs of size near a megabyte,
the two programs are of roughly comparable speed.
Because Kernighan and Pike use a slightly larger structure
and make extensive use of the inefficient <i>malloc</i>,
the program in this column uses an order of
magnitude less memory on my system.
If we incorporate the speedup of Solution 14
and replace the binary search and sorting by a hash table,
<a href="markovhash.c">the program in this section</a>
becomes about a factor of two
faster (and increases memory use by about 50%).
