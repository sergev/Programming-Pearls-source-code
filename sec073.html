<P>
The output of any calculation is only as good as its input.
With good data, simple calculations can yield
accurate answers that are sometimes quite useful.
Don Knuth once wrote a disk sorting package,
only to find that it took twice
the time predicted by his calculations.
Diligent checking uncovered the flaw:
due to a software bug, the
system's one-year-old disks had run at only
half their advertised speed for their entire lives.
When the bug was fixed,
Knuth's sorting package behaved as predicted
and every other disk-bound program also ran faster.

<P>
Often, though,
sloppy input is enough to get into the right ballpark.
(The estimation quiz in Appendix 2 may help you to
judge the quality of your guesses.)
If you guess about twenty percent here and fifty percent there
and still find that a design is a hundred
times above or below specification,
additional accuracy isn't needed.
But before placing too much confidence
in a twenty percent margin of error,
consider Vic Vyssotsky's advice from
a talk he has given on several occasions.

<P>
``Most of you'', says Vyssotsky,
``probably recall pictures of `Galloping Gertie', the Tacoma
Narrows Bridge which tore itself apart in a windstorm in 1940.
Well, suspension bridges had been ripping themselves
apart that way for eighty years or so before Galloping Gertie.
It's an aerodynamic lift phenomenon,
and to do a proper engineering calculation of the forces,
which involve drastic nonlinearities,
you have to use the mathematics and concepts of
Kolmogorov to model the eddy spectrum.
Nobody really knew how to do this correctly in detail until
the 1950's or thereabouts.
So, why hasn't the Brooklyn Bridge torn itself apart,
like Galloping Gertie?

<P>
``It's because John Roebling had sense enough to know what he
<i>didn't</i> know.
His notes and letters on the design of the
Brooklyn Bridge still exist,
and they are a fascinating example of a good engineer
recognizing the limits of his knowledge.
He knew about aerodynamic lift on suspension bridges;
he had watched it.
And he knew he didn't know enough to model it.
So he designed the stiffness of the truss on the Brooklyn Bridge
roadway to be
<i> six times</i>
what a normal calculation based on known static and dynamic
loads would have called for.
And, he specified a network of
diagonal stays running down to the roadway,
to stiffen the entire bridge structure.
Go look at those sometime; they're almost unique.

<P>
``When Roebling was asked whether his proposed bridge wouldn't
collapse like so many others, he said, `No, because I designed it
six times as strong as it needs to be, to prevent that from happening.'

<P>
``Roebling was a good engineer,
and he built a good bridge,
by employing a huge safety factor to compensate for his ignorance.
Do we do that?
I submit to you that in calculating performance of our real-time
software systems we ought to derate them by a factor of two,
or four, or six,
to compensate for our ignorance.
In making reliability/availability commitments,
we ought to stay back from the objectives we <i>think</i>
we can meet by a factor of ten,
to compensate for our ignorance.
In estimating size and cost and schedule,
we should be conservative by a factor of two
or four to compensate for our ignorance.
We should design the way John Roebling did,
and not the way his contemporaries did -- so far as I know,
none of the suspension bridges built by Roebling's contemporaries
in the United States still stands,
and a quarter of all the bridges of any type
built in the U.S. in the 1870's collapsed within ten years of
their construction.

<P>
``Are we engineers, like John Roebling?  I wonder.''
