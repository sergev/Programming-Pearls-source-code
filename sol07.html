<h1>Solutions
<br>(To Column 7 of

</h1>

<P>
These solutions include guesses at constants
that may be off by a factor of two
from their correct values as this book goes to press,
but not much further.

<P>
1. The Passaic River does not flow at 200 miles per hour,
even when falling 80 feet over
the beautiful Great Falls in Patterson, New Jersey.
I suspect that the engineer really told the reporter that the
engorged river was flowing at 200 miles
<i>per day</i>,
five times faster than its typical 40 miles per day,
which is just under a leisurely 2 miles per hour.

<p>
2.
An old removable disk holds 100 megabytes.
An ISDN line transmits 112 kilobits per second,
or about 50 megabytes per hour.
This gives a cyclist with a disk in his pocket
about two hours to pedal,
or a 15-mile radius of superiority.
For a more interesting race,
put a hundred DVDs in the cyclist's backpack,
and his bandwidth goes up by a factor of 17,000;
upgrade the line to ATM at 155 megabits per second,
for a factor of 1400 increase.
This gives the cyclist another factor of 12,
or one day to pedal.
(The day after I wrote this paragraph,
I walked into a colleague's office to see
200 5-gigabyte write-once media platters
in a pile on his desk.
In 1999,
a terabyte of unwritten media was a stunning sight.)

<p>
3. A floppy disk contains 1.44 megabytes.
Flat out, my typing is about fifty words (or 300 bytes)
per minute.
I can therefore fill a floppy in 4800 minutes,
or 80 hours.
(The input text for this book is only half a megabyte,
but it took me substantially longer than three days to type it.)

<p>
4. I was hoping for answers along the lines of
a ten-nanosecond instruction takes a hundredth of a second,
an 11 millisecond disk rotation (at 5400 rpm) takes 3 hours,
a 20 msec seek takes 6 hours,
and the two seconds to type my name takes about a month.
A clever reader wrote,
``How long does it take?
Exactly the same time as before,
if the clock slows down, too.''

<p>
5. For the rate between 5 and 10 percent,
the Rule-of-72 estimate is accurate to within one percent.

<p>
6. Since 72/1.33 is approximately 54,
we would expect the population to double by 2052
(the UN estimates happily call for the rate
to drop substantially).

<p>
9. Ignoring slowdown due to queueing,
20 milliseconds (of seek time) per disk operation gives
2 seconds per transaction or 1800 transactions per hour.

<p>
10. One could estimate the local death rate by counting death notices
in a newspaper and estimating the population of the area they represent.
An easier approach uses Little's Law
and an estimate of life expectancy;
if the life expectancy is 70 years, for instance,
then $1/70$ or 1.4% of the population dies each year.

<p>
11. Peter Denning's proof of Little's Law has two parts.
``First, define <i>lambda=A/T</i>, the arrival rate,
where A is the number of arrivals
during an observation period of length <i>T</i>.
Define <i>X=C/T</i>, the output rate,
where <i>C</i> is the number of completions during <i>T</i>.
Let <i>n(t)</i> denote the number in the system at time <i>t</i> in [0,<i>T</i>].
Let <i>W</i> be the area under <i>n(t)</i>, in units of `item-seconds',
representing the total aggregated waiting time
over all items in the system during the observation period.
The mean response time per item completed is
defined as <i>R=W/C</i>,
in units of (item-seconds)/(item).
The mean number in the system is the average height of n(t)
and is <i>L</i> = <i>W/T</i>,
in units of (item-seconds)/(second).
It is now obvious that <i>L=RX</i>.
This formulation is in terms of the output rate only.
There is no requirement for `flow balance', i.e.,
that flow in equal flow out (in symbols, <i>lambda=X</i>).
If you add that assumption,
the formula becomes <i>L=lambda*R</i>,
which is the form encountered in queueing and system theory.''

<P>
12. When I read that a quarter has ``an average life of 30 years'',
that number seemed high to me;
I didn't recall seeing that many old quarters.
I therefore dug into my pocket,
and found a dozen quarters.
Here are their ages in years:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3  4  5  7  9  9  12  17  17  19  20  34
<br>
The average age is 13 years,
which is perfectly consistent with a quarter having
an average life of about twice that
(over this rather uniform distribution of ages).
Had I come up with a dozen quarters
all less than five years old,
I might have dug further into the topic.
This time, though,
I guessed that the paper had got it right.

<p>
The same article reported that ``there will be a minimum of
750 million New Jersey quarters made'' and also that a new state
quarter would be issued every 10 weeks.
That multiplies to about four billion quarters per year,
or a dozen new quarters for each
resident of the United States.
A life of 30 years per quarter means that each person
has 360 quarters out there.
That is too many for pockets alone,
but it is plausible if we include piles of change
at home and in cars,
and a lot in cash registers and banks.
