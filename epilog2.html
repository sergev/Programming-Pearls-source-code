<h1>Epilog to the Second Edition of
<br><font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font></h1>

<P>
Some
<a href="epilog1.html">traditions</a>
are continued for their inherent quality.
Others persist anyway.

<p><i>Q:</i>
Welcome back; it's been a long time.
<p><i>A:</i>
Fourteen years.

<p><i>Q:</i>
Let's start where we did before.
Why a new edition of the book?
<p><i>A:</i>
I like the book, a lot.
It was fun to write,
and the readers have been very kind over the years.
The principles in the book
have stood the test of time,
but many examples in the
<a href="firsted.html">first edition</a>
were
<a href="why2e.html#vaxtimes">woefully out of date</a>.
Modern readers can't relate to a ``huge'' computer
that has a half-megabyte of main memory.

<p><i>Q:</i>
So what did you change in this edition?
<p><i>A:</i>
Pretty much
<a href="preface.html#firstedition">
what I said I changed in the preface</a>.
Don't you guys prepare before these interviews?

<p><i>Q:</i>
Oops -- sorry.
I see that you talk there about how the code
for this book is available at the web site.
<p><i>A:</i>
Writing that code was the most fun that I had
in working on this edition.
I implemented most of the programs in the first edition,
but mine were the only eyes to see the real code.
For this edition I wrote about
2500 lines of C and C++,
to be shown to the whole world.

<p><i>Q:</i>
You call that code ready for public view?
I've read some of it; what dreadful style!
Microscopic variable names,
weird function definitions,
global variables that should be parameters,
and the list goes on.
Aren't you embarrassed to let
real software engineers see the code?
<p><i>A:</i>
The style I used can indeed prove fatal
in large software projects.
This book, however,
is not a large software project.
It's not even a large book.
<a href="sol05.html">Solution 5.1</a>
describes the terse coding style
and why I chose it.
Had I wanted to write a thousand-page book,
I would have adopted a lengthier coding style.

<p><i>Q:</i>
Speaking of long code,
your
<a href="sort.cpp"><i>sort.cpp</i></a>
program measures the C Standard Library <i>qsort</i>,
the C++ Standard Template Library <i>sort</i>,
and several hand-made Quicksorts.
Can't you make up your mind?
Should a programmer use library functions
or build code from scratch?
<p><i>A:</i>
Tom Duff gave the best answer to that question:
``Whenever possible, steal code.''
Libraries are great; use them whenever they do the job.
Start with your system library,
then search other libraries for appropriate functions.
In any engineering activity, though,
not all artifacts can be all things to all customers.
When the library functions don't measure up,
you may have to build your own.
I hope that the pseudocode fragments in the book
(and the real code on the web site)
will prove a useful starting point for programmers
who have to write their own functions.
I think that the scaffolding and the experimental
approach of this book will help those programmers to
evaluate a variety of algorithms and choose the
best one for their application.

<p><i>Q:</i>
Apart from the public code and updating some stories,
what is <i>really</i> new in this edition?
<p><i>A:</i>
I've tried to confront code tuning in the
presence of caches and instruction-level parallelism.
At a larger level,
the three new columns reflect
three major changes that pervade this edition:
Column 5 describes real code and scaffolding,
Column 13 gives details on data structures, and
<a href="strings.html">Column 15</a>
derives advanced algorithms.
Most of the ideas in the book have appeared in
print before,
but the cost model for space in
<a href="appmodels.html">Appendix 3</a>
and the Markov-text algorithm in
<a href="sec153.html">Section 15.3</a>
are presented here for the first time.
The new Markov-text algorithm compares quite
favorably to the classic algorithm described by
Kernighan and Pike.

<p><i>Q:</i>
There you go with more Bell Labs people.
The last time we talked,
you were enthusiastic about the place,
but you had only been there a few years.
Lots has changed at the Labs in the last 14 years;
what do you now think about the place and the changes?
<p><i>A:</i>
When I wrote the first columns in the book,
<a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>
was part of the Bell System.
When the first edition was published,
we were part of AT&T;
now we are part of
<a href="http://www.lucent.com/">Lucent Technologies</a>.
The companies,
the telecommunications industry,
and the field of computing
have all changed dramatically in that period.
Bell Labs
has kept up with those changes,
and has often led the way.
I came to the Labs because I enjoy balancing
the theoretical and the applied,
because I want to build products and write books.
The pendulum has swung back and forth during
my years at the Labs,
but my management has always encouraged
a wide range of activities.

<p>
A reviewer of the first edition of this book
<a href="http://www.ercb.com/ddj/1991/ddj.9106.html">wrote</a>
``Bentley's everyday working environment is
a programming nirvana.
He is a Member of Technical Staff at
<a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>
in 
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/info/site.html">
Murray Hill</a>,
New Jersey,
has immediate access to cutting-edge hardware
and software technology,
and stands in line at the cafeteria with some
of the most brilliant software developers in the world.''
Bell Labs is still that kind of place.

<p><i>Q:</i>
Nirvana every single day of the week?
<p><i>A:</i>
Nirvana many days,
and pretty darn nice the others.
