<p>
<i>String Problems.</i>
How does your compiler look up a variable name
in its symbol table?
How does your help system quickly search that whole
CD-ROM as you type in each character of your query string?
How does a web search engine look up a phrase?
These real problems use some of the techniques
that we've glimpsed in the toy problems of this column.

<p>
<i>Data Structures for Strings.</i>
We've seen several of the most important data structures
used for representing strings.
<DL>

<DT><DD>
<i>Hashing.</i>
This structure is fast on the average and simple to implement.

<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>Balanced Trees.</i>
These structures guarantee good performance even
on perverse inputs,
and are nicely packaged in most implementations of
the C++ Standard Template Library's <i>set</i>s and <i>map</i>s.

<br><br><DT><DD>
<i>Suffix Arrays.</i>
Initialize an array of pointers to every character
(or every word) in your text,
sort them,
and you have a suffix array.
You can then scan through it to find near strings
or use binary search to look up words or phrases.

</DL>

Section 13.8 uses several additional structures
to represent the words in a dictionary.

<p>
<i>Libraries or Custom-Made Components?</i>
The <i>set</i>s, <i>map</i>s and <i>string</i>s of the C++ STL
were very convenient to use,
but their general and powerful interface meant
that they were not as efficient as a
special-purpose hash function.
Other library components were very efficient:
hashing used <i>strcmp</i> and suffix arrays used <i>qsort</i>.
I peeked at the library implementations
of <i>bsearch</i> and <i>strcmp</i> to build
the binary search and the <i>wordncmp</i> functions
in the Markov program.
