The programmer told me about his problem in a phone call;
it took us about fifteen minutes to get to the real problem
and find the bitmap solution.
It took him a couple of hours to implement the program in a
few dozen lines of code,
which was far superior to the hundreds of lines of code
and the week of programming time that we had feared
at the start of the phone call.
And the program was lightning fast:
while a Merge Sort on disk might have taken many minutes,
this program took little more than the time to read the
input and to write the output -- about ten seconds.
Solution 3 contains timing details on several programs
for the task.

<p>
Those facts contain the first lesson from this case study:
careful analysis of a small problem can sometimes
yield tremendous practical benefits.
In this case a few minutes of careful study led to an order of
magnitude reduction in code length,
programmer time and run time.
General Chuck Yeager
(the first person to fly faster than sound)
praised an airplane's engine system with the words
``simple, few parts, easy to maintain, very strong'';
this program shares those attributes.
The program's specialized structure, however,
would be hard to modify if certain dimensions
of the specifications were changed.
In addition to the advertising for clever programming,
this case illustrates the following general principles.

<p>
<i>The Right Problem.</i>
Defining the problem was about ninety percent
of this battle -- I'm glad that the programmer didn't
settle for the first program I described.
Problems
<a href="sec016.html#p10">10</a>,
<a href="sec016.html#p11">11</a>
and
<a href="sec016.html#p12">12</a>
have elegant solutions once you pose
the right problem;
think hard about them before looking at the hints and solutions.

<p>
<i>The Bitmap Data Structure.</i>
This data structure represents a dense set
over a finite domain when each element occurs at
most once and no other data is associated with the element.
Even if these conditions aren't satisfied
(when there are multiple elements or extra data,
for instance),
a key from a finite domain can be used as
an index into a table with more complicated entries;
see Problems
<a href="sec016.html#p6">6</a>
and
<a href="sec016.html#p8">8</a>.

<p>
<i>Multiple-Pass Algorithms.</i>
These algorithms make several passes over their input
data, accomplishing a little more each time.
We saw a 40-pass algorithm in
<a href="sec013.html">Section 1.3</a>; 
Problem 5 encourages you to develop a two-pass algorithm.

<p>
<i>A Time-Space Tradeoff and One That Isn't.</i>
Programming folklore and theory abound with
time-space tradeoffs:
by using more time, a program can run in less space.
The two-pass algorithm in Solution 5, for instance,
doubles a program's run time to halve its space.
It has been my experience more frequently, though,
that reducing a program's space requirements also
reduces its run time.
(Tradeoffs are common to all engineering disciplines;
automobile designers, for instance, might trade
reduced mileage for faster acceleration by adding
heavy components.
Mutual improvements are preferred, though.
A review of a small car I once drove observed that
``the weight saving on the car's basic structure translates
into further weight reductions in the various chassis
components -- and even the elimination of the need
for some, such as power steering''.)
The space-efficient structure of bitmaps dramatically
reduced the run time of sorting.
There were two reasons that the 
reduction in space led to a reduction in time:
less data to process means less time to process it,
and keeping data in main memory rather than on disk
avoids the overhead of disk accesses.
Of course,
the mutual improvement was possible only because the
original design was far from optimal.

<p>
<i>A Simple Design.</i>
Antoine de Saint-Exupery,
the French writer and aircraft designer, said that,
``A designer
knows he has arrived at perfection not when there is no longer
anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take
away.''
More programmers should judge their work by this criterion.
Simple programs are usually more
reliable, secure, robust and efficient than their
complex cousins,
and easier to build and to maintain.

<p>
<i>Stages of Program Design.</i>
This case illustrates the design process that is described in
detail in Section 12.4.
