<h1>A Small Matter of Programming
<br>(A Sketch of Column 5 of
<font color="#a52a2a">Programming Pearls</font>)
</h1>

<P>
So far, you've done everything right.
You dug deep to define the right problem.
You balanced the true requirements with
a careful selection of algorithms and data structures.
You used the techniques of program verification
to write elegant pseudocode that you're
pretty sure is correct.
How do you incorporate the
resulting gem into your big system?
All that's left is, well,
a small matter of programming.

<p>
Programmers are optimists,
and they are tempted to take the easy path:
code up the function,
slip it into the system,
and fervently hope that it runs.
Sometimes that works.
But the other 999 times out of 1000,
it leads to disaster:
one has to grope around in the huge system
to manipulate the little function.

<p>
Wise programmers instead build
<i>scaffolding</i>
to give them easy access to the function.
This column is devoted to implementing the
binary search described in pseudocode in the last column
as a trustworthy C function.
(The code would be very similar in C++ or Java,
and the approach works for most other languages.)
Once we have the code,
we'll probe it with scaffolding,
then move on to test it more thoroughly
and conduct experiments on its running time.
For a tiny function, our path is long.
The result, though, is a program we can trust.
